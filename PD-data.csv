I dont want to talk about it.;Freedom Rule;"""I prefer to keep that matter to myself.”";A: This sentence violates the Freedom Rule. Parties must not prevent each other from advancing standpoints or from casting doubt on standpoints. By keeping the mater to themselves the speaker is preventing the exchange of arguments, hindering the dialectical process, thus the Freedom Rule being violated.;
Nobody in his right mind can deny it;Freedom Rule;"""It's undeniable to anyone thinking clearly.";A: Parties must not prevent each other from advancing standpoints, in this case by declaring a sandpoint as sacroscant (any sensible person would agree) we are rendering the standpoint immune to cristicism which prevent the other party from advancing their standpoint. This clearly violates the Freedom Rule.;

;;Any sensible person would agree;;
You'll have to face the consequences for our personal relationship;Freedom Rule;This choice will impact your future prospects within the company.;Parties must not prevent each other from advancing standpoints. Putting pressure on the oponent (here: his choice will affect his job) is a clear violating of the Freedom Rule. Because of the implications, the other party might not advance their standpoint and this is exactly in violation of the Freedom Rule, where parties must not prevent each other from advancing or casting doubt on standpoints.;
You can't do that to me;Freedom Rule;You have to help me;Parties must not prevent each other from advancing standpoints. By putting pressure on the opponent ( you “have” to help me) is an appeal to pity and can potentially prevent the oponent from advancing his standpoints. This clearly violates the Freedom Rule since it is preventing the oponent from advancing his standpoint.;You have to help me

Don't listen to this moron, crook, liar, etc.;Freedom Rule;Anyone who says that about me [that he’s a racist;Parties must not prevent each other from advancing standpoints. If you perform a personal attack on the oponent by depicting him as stupid, bad, etc you directly violate the Freedom Rule.

;;;;Q: Don't listen to this moron, crook, liar, etc.
;;;;
;;;;"A: The sentence violates the Freedom Rule of Pragma-Dialectics. This rule states that parties must not prevent each other from advancing standpoints or from casting doubt on standpoints. By using derogatory terms like """"moron, crook, liar,"""" the speaker attempts to discredit the opponent and dissuade others from listening to them, thus infringing on their freedom to present their arguments."
He just says so because he wants to be elected;Freedom Rule;She only agrees with that because she wants to win their approval;Parties must not prevent each other from advancing standpoints. By performing a personal attack on the opponent by casting suspicion on her motives (you’re doubting that she truly agrees with that if it weren’t for the approval) the Freedom rule is clearly violated.;
Look who says so!;Freedom Rule;"""That's like a thief lecturing about honesty.”";Parties must not prevent each other from advancing standpoints. By performing a personal attack on the oponent y pointing out an inconsistency between his ideas (honesty) and his deeds (the analogy with the thief) in the past and present the Freedom Rule is clearly violated.;
The facts speak for themselves…;Obligation to Defend Rule;The situation reveals everything without words.;Whoever advances as standpoint is obliged to defend it. Evading the burden of proof by presenting the standpoint as self-evident (the situation reveals everything so its self evident) the Obligation To Defend rule is clearly violated.;
'I can assure you that…;Obligation to Defend Rule;You have my word on this matter;Whoever advances as standpoint is obliged to defend it. Evading the burden of proof by giving a personal guarantee of the rightness of the standpoints ( giving them your word) clearly violates the Obligation To Defend Rule.;
It is part of human nature that…;Obligation to Defend Rule;1. By instinct, women tend to…;Q: By instinct, women tend to…;
;;;;
;;;A: Immunizing a standpoint agaist criticism, thus shifting the burden of proof by adding essentialistic quantifications here: ‘women tend to’, violates the ‘Obligation to Defend Rule’. The fallacy of evading the burden of proof.;

If you don't believe me, just prove I'm wrong;Obligation to Defend Rule;Should you question my claim, I welcome you to verify it yourself.;Whoever advances as standpoint is obliged to defend it. Shifting the burden of proof by demanding the antagonist to show that the standpoint is wrong (here ‘verify it yourself’) clearly violates. the Obligation To Defend Rule.;
I don't know about my opponent but I personally regard it as extremely important that...;Standpoint Rule;Unlike some, I hold the view that it's actually necessary..;An attack on a standpoint must relate to the standpoint that has really been advances by the protagonist. Imputing a fictitious standpoint to someone by emphatically advancing a standpoint implying the opponent takes the opposite view (here ‘unlike some’ you imply your opponent has the opposite view) clearly violates the Standpoint Rule.;
That may be what he says now, but as a communist he naturally does not mean a word of it;Standpoint Rule;He declares that belief at the moment, but as a career politician, his words often lack sincerity.;An attack on a standpoint must relate to the standpoint that has really been advances by the protagonist. Imputing a fictitious standpoint to someone by referring to views of the group to which the opponent belongs (politicians are not sincere, hence the oponent is also not sincere) clearly violates the Standpoint Rule.;
Although almost everybody believes that. ..’;Standpoint Rule;;A: The standpoint has now been made fictitious, by creating a non-existent oponent as indicated by ‘no one shares…’. Imputing a fictitious standpoint to someone violates the ‘Standpoint Rule’ of Pragma-Dialectics also known as the straw man fallacy.;
'You do want your children to be safe in your own neighbourhood, don't you?;Relevance Rule;Surely, you desire a quality education for your children, right?;When defending a standpoint the protagonist uses argumentation only and that argumentation genuinely relates to the disputed standpoint. In this case the protagonist is not using argumentation but playing on the emotion or prejudices of the audience (people desire quality education for their children). By using non-argumentation the Relevance Rule is violated, since desiring quality education is not relevant to whether the education is or isn’t qualitative.;
As an expert in the field I can say with some emphasis that…;Relevance Rule;As someone deeply involved in this field, I think that…;When defending a standpoint the protagonist uses argumentation only and that argumentation genuinely relates to the disputed standpoint. In this case the protagonist is not using argumentation but parading their own qualities. This clearly violates the Relevance Rule because in this case the expertise in the fiels does not count as an argument.;
A: ‘John is at home, because his car's in the drive' B: 'So you think people never go out without taking their cars';Unexpressed Premise Rule;"A: ""She's at the gym; her running shoes are gone."" B: ""Are you implying people can't do other activities in their running shoes?”";The Unexpressed Premise Rule says that a person ca be held to the premises he leaves implicit. Here by saying “Are you implying people can't do other activities in their running shoes?’ B is reconstructing an unexpressed premiss beyond what the protagonist can be held to (blows up what has been left implicit) violating the Unexpressed Premise Rule.;
A: 'John is at home, because his car's in the drive' B: 'So you think John does not go out without taking the car' A: 'Not at all. What makes you think so?’;Unexpressed Premise Rule;"A: ""She's at the gym; her running shoes are gone."" B: ""Are you implying people can't do other activities in their running shoes?”";The Unexpressed Premise Rule says that a person ca be held to the premises he leaves implicit. Here ‘A’ at the end refutes (’Not at all. Why would you say that?) her implicit premiss which was correctly picked up by ‘B’ because ‘A’ does imply that if the gym shoes are gone, the other person is at the gym.;
;;A: Not at all. Why would you say that?’;;
Where did you hide the murder weapon?;Starting Point Rule;Why did you lie”;To resolve a dispute a common starting point of facts, values etc. is required. In this case we have a false presentation of something as a starting point. “Why did you lie”, wraps up a proposition in a presupposition and makes unfair use of that presuppositions in asking questions, thus violating the “Starting Point Rule”;
;;;;
'This applicant is unsuitable because she is married’;Starting Point Rule;;To resolve a dispute a common starting point of facts, values is required. In this case, we have a false presentation of a starting point, because of the hiding away of a proposition in an unexpressed premise, which is that people with young children do not make good employees. Thus violating the “Starting Point Rule”;
'I am right, because what I say is true’;Starting Point Rule;The reason I keep insisting that there was a relationship between Iraq and Saddam and al-Qaida is because there was a relationship between Iraq and al-Qaida.;If the argument advanced is the same at the standpoint i.e the truth of the same thing trying to be proven is assumed, the petitio principii fallacy occurs. The petitio principii fallacy also means that the Starting Point Rule is violated.;
'What's wrong with adultery anyway?’;Starting Point Rule;Whats the big deal with committing plagiarism?;To resolve a dispute a common starting point of facts, values is required. By denying this common start point, the “Starting Point Rule” gets violated. In this case the expression “Whats the big deal with committing plagiarism?” casts doubt on the starting point which is already a fact that plagiarism is unethical.;
'Professor X says so, so it must be true’;Argument Scheme Rule;Given that it's confirmed by MIT researchers, it's undoubtedly accurate.;By applying the wrong scheme of argumentation like in this case a truth or acceptability (’ its undoubtedly accurate) of a standpoint is established by referring to some kind of authority (MIT researchers), this is a case of symptomatic argumentation and it is not a suitable argumentation scheme. This examples clearly violates the Argument Scheme Rule by applying an unsuitable argument scheme.;
'Everybody says so, so it must be true’;Argument Scheme Rule;Given that it's confirmed by MIT researchers, it's undoubtedly accurate.;By applying the wrong scheme of argumentation like in this case a truth or acceptability (’ its undoubtedly accurate) of a standpoint is established by referring to some kind of authority (MIT researchers), this is a case of symptomatic argumentation and it is not a suitable argumentation scheme. This examples clearly violates the Argument Scheme Rule by applying an unsuitable argument scheme.;
'This can't be true because it would destroy everything this country stands for’;Argument Scheme Rule;"""This simply can't hold water, as it would contradict everything our institution represents.";Applying an unsuitable scheme of argumentation by testing the truth or acceptability (this simply cant hold water) by pointing out undesirable consequences (it would contradict everything out institution represents) the Argument Scheme Rule is violated. An argument cannot be true or false based on the consequences it leads to (here the argumentum ad consequentiam is being used) , hence the Argument Scheme rule being violated.;
'The American medical system doesn't care what happens to the patient. I know of a man who was turned away by a hospital and then died’;Argument Scheme Rule;"The education system ignores student well-being; I know a child who was overlooked and fell behind.";The Argument Scheme Rule is violated when inappropriately applying a scheme of argumentation. In this case by justifying a general conclusion (the education system ignored student well-being) on the basis of an insufficient number of nonrepresentative observations ( one child who was overlooked) the Argument Scheme Rule is violated (hasty generalization).;"Q: The education system ignores student well-being; I know a child who was overlooked and fell behind"
;;;;
;;;;A: The Argument Scheme Rule is violated when inappropriately applying a scheme of argumentation. In this case by justifying a general conclusion (the education system ignored student well-being) on the basis of an insufficient number of nonrepresentative observations ( one child who was overlooked) the Argument Scheme Rule is violated (hasty generalization).
;;;;
;;;;Q: The American medical system doesn't care what happens to the patient. I know of a man who was turned away by a hospital and then died
;;;;
;;;;
;;;;"A: ""The sentence violates the Argument Scheme Rule by using an inappropriate argument scheme, specifically a hasty generalization. It draws a general conclusion about the American medical system based on a single instance, which is not representative of the entire system.”"
'You can't have a compact disc, your father and I didn't have one when we are were young’;Argument Scheme Rule;;Q: People who have to have a cup of coffee every morning before they can function have no less a problem than alcoholics who have to have their alcohol each day to sustain them.;
;;;;
;;;A: The analogy that alcohol and coffee are harmful in the same way just because people can be addicted both to coffee and alcohol is a false analogy, because here we are defending an opinion by comparing the matter in question with another essentially different matter. A false analogy violates the “Argument Scheme” rule in Pragma Dialectics.;
;;;;
;;;"Q: ""You can't get a smartphone, I never had one at your age.”";
;;;;
;;;A: By comparing the matter at hand (the kid getting a smartphone) in question which another, essentially different matter (the other person not having had one as a kid) the ‘Argument Scheme rule is violated because of the use of a false analogy.;
'The fact that the shops are closed on Sundays is caused by the fact that they are open on Saturdays’;Argument Scheme Rule;;When arguing the right scheme of argumentation should be applied. In this case by inferring a casue effect relation from the mere observation that two events take place one after the other (post hoc ergo propter hoc), the ‘Argumentation Scheme is violated”;
'Tolerating euthanasia leads to genocide. That's why I'm opposed to it’;Argument Scheme Rule;;When arguing the right scheme of argumentation should be applied. In this case by rejecting a course of action (negotiating with terrorists) becasue it is supposed to lead us from bad to worse (more terrorist attacts) , whereas it is not necessary for the alleged consequence to occur at all, the ‘Argument Scheme’ rule is violated because of the slippery slope fallacy present.;
'If the traffic in the area is really bad, the road should be widened’;Validity Rule;;Q: If the classroom is too crowded, the school should add more classes.;
;;;;
;;;A: An argument can be made invalid and thus violate the ‘Validity Rule’ of Pragma dialectics when a necessary condition is treated as a sufficient condition, also known as denying the antecendent. In this case the classroom being too crowded is a necessary but not sufficient condition, there are other reasons why more classes(rooms) should be added to the school (like budget, new subjects being offered etc). In this case the sentence clearly violates the ‘Validity Rule’ of Pragma Dialectics.;
;;;;
;;;;
;;;Q: If you are a proofreader you have a job.;
;;;;
;;;A: Proof reading is a job, so being a proofreader you have a job. But negating the antecendent (being a proofreader), means not being a proofreader you dont have a job, but this overlooks every other job someone could have. Denying the antencendent violates the Validity Rule.;
;;;;
;;;Q: If the traffic in the area is really bad, the road should be widened;
'There aren't any problems with the traffic in the area, so there is no need for the road to be widened’;Validity Rule;The park is always clean and well-maintained, so there's no need for additional funding for its upkeep;When arguing, the arguments should always be valid otherwise the Validity Rule is violated and this is exactly the case with “The park is always clean and well-maintained, so there's no need for additional funding for its upkeep”. The park not being clean and well-maintained is ‘a’ reason for additional funding (necessary condition) but it is not the only reason why the park shouldn’t get additional funding (we need sufficient conditions). If you treat a necessary condition as a sufficient condition you end up with an invalid argument, breaking the Validity Rule.;
;;;;
;;;;
;;;Lets break the sentence down: “The park is always clean and well maintained” implies that the park not being well maintained (necessary condition for additional funding) is the only reason why the park should get “ additional funding for its upkeep”. Here we have the case of necessary condition being treated as a sufficient condition, but that is fallacious since there are other reasons to fund the park. When a necessary condition is treated as a sufficient condition the Validity Rule is violated as we have it in this case.;
'They are widening the road, so the traffic there must be really terrible’;Validity Rule;;Q: if the lamp were broken, then the room would be dark;
;;;;
;;;A: This sentence violates the ‘Validity rule’ of pragma dialectics because treatig the ‘lamp being broken’ as the only reason why a room would be dark is in invalid argument. Hence it being an invalid argument and violating the Validity Rule of Pragma Dialectics.;
'This is a light boat, so the anchor of this boat is light’;Validity Rule;This is a small room, so the furniture in this room is compact.;The ‘Validity Rule’ states that when arguing the argument should be valid. In this case, we have the case where a small room means that the furniture is compact, this is not a valid argument since a property of a whole is incorrectly ascribed to one or more parts, it can very well be that the room contains one large piece of furniture instead of having only compact furniture. This is the fallacy of division and violates the Validity Rule.;
'This boat is made of excellent materials, so it is an excellent boat’;Validity Rule;The house is built with premium-grade materials, making it a first-class home.;he ‘Validity Rule’ states that when arguing the argument should be valid. In this case we have that a house beig built with premium-grade materials makes it a first-class home which is not a valid argument since a property of one or more parts of a whole is incorrectly ascribed to the whole, it can very well be that the way the house is built is so impractical it fails to be a first-class home rendering the materials useless. This is the fallacy of the composition which violates the Validity Rule.;
'You can't have any objections anymore, so what I said is true’;Concluding Rule;Since there's no further debate, it's clear that my solution is effective.;At the concluding stage if the standpoint if the protagonist overdoes his victory if he claims from a successful defence(”there’s no further debate) that his standpoint has been proved true, the Concluding rule is violated, because there are many reasons why there is not further debate (the antagonist sees no point, the antagonist is not well prepared etc.), so claiming that now the standpoint is true just becasue there is no futher development, is a fallacious argument. Here the Concluding Rule is violated.;
A: 'I'm giving up smoking, because it gives you cancer' B: 'Nobody has proved that conclusively, so you can carry on smoking without any fear for getting cancer’;Concluding Rule;"A: I'm going to read more books to improve my brain function and knowledge.""";"A: I'm going to read more books to improve my brain function and knowledge.""";
;;"B: ""Reading isn't the only way to improve brain function and knowledge, so you don't need to read more.""";"B: ""Reading isn't the only way to improve brain function and knowledge, so you don't need to read more.""";
;;;;
;;;Q: If you conclude that a standpoint (reading more) is not true (you dont need to read more) because it hasnt been successfully defended that it is the only way to improve brain function and knowledge, you violate the ‘Concluding Rule’ of pragma dialectics which is violated by the antagonist when he/she concludes that a standpoint is true because the opposite has not been successfully defended.;
;;;;
;;;A:'I'm giving up smoking, because it gives you cancer';
;;;B: 'Nobody has proved that conclusively, so you can carry on smoking without any fear for getting cancer';
A: 'I'm giving up sex because it's bad for my health' B: 'That's never been proved, so it's very good for you’;Concluding Rule;"A: ""I'm not using social media; it's bad for mental health."" B: ""There's no concrete proof of that, so it's very beneficial for you.";At the end of the debate, if you you conclude a standpoint true (social media being very beneficial for you) just because the opposite has not been proven true and present a false dilema like in this case, the Concluding Rule is violated.;
A: 'Charles is a kleptomaniac' B: 'Is this just a statement, or a warning?’;Language Use Rule;A: ‘Mike has a reputation for being a hothead.’ B: ‘Is that an observation or a piece of advice?’;Unclear usage at the sentence level like ‘B’ makes it known with ‘Is that an observation or a piece of advice’ i.e why exactly did ‘A’ express that statement , indicates that A was unclear as to why he said that Mike has a reputation for being a hothead. This exchange violates the Language Use Rule which states that no unclearness should be present when trying to resolve a dispute.;
A: 'Charles is a kleptomaniac' B: 'Who do you mean by Charles, your neighbour or your brotherin-law?’;Language Use Rule;A: ‘Mike has a reputation for being a hothead.’ B: ‘Who is Mike?’;Unclear usage like we have here with ‘Who is Mike’ clearly violates the Language Rule which states that formulations must be neither puzzlingly vague nor confusingly ambiguous and must be interpreted as accurately as possible. Here we have a clear violation of the Language Use Rule;
A: 'Charles is a kleptomaniac' B: 'What's a kleptomaniac?’;Language Use Rule;A: ‘Mike has a reputation for being a hothead.’ B: ‘What is a hothead.’;In the case of of a unfamiliar predication of a speech act here ‘What is a hothead?’ the Language Rule is clearly violated. The rule states that formulations must be neither puzzlingly vague nor confusingly ambiguous and must be interpreted as accurately as possible. Here we have a clear violation of the Language Use Rule because for ‘B’ it is not clear what a hothead is.;
A: 'Charles is a kleptomaniac' B: 'Does he steal everyday, then?’;Language Use Rule;A: ‘Mike has a reputation for being a hothead.’ B: ‘Does he get mad at everyone?;In case of a vague prediction here ‘ Does he get mad at everyone? where ‘B’ only vaguely predicts what the following of Mike being a hothead is, the Language use is clearly violated because it states that formulations must be neither puzzlingly vague nor confusingly ambiguous and must be interpreted as accurately as possible. Here we have a clear violation of the Language Use Rule because of ‘B’.;
A: 'There was a leaf on the floor' B: 'What do you mean, a leaf from a plant or from a book?’;Language Use Rule;"A: ""I saw a bat in the attic."" B: ""Do you mean a bat like the animal or a baseball bat?”";Semantic ambiguity explicitly violates the Langage Use Rule. Here we have the ambiguous meaning of the word ‘bat’ which clearly breaks the Language Use Rule which states that formulations must not be confusingly ambiguous and must be interpreted as accurately as possible.;
A: 'I'm not going with you because of the rain' B: 'What do you mean, (a) are you not going and is the reason for it 'that it's raining, or (b) are you going and is the reason for it not that it's raining, but some other reason?’;Language Use Rule;"A: ‘I'm watching the dog in my pajamas.""";Syntactic ambiguity violates the Language Use Rule. Here we do not know is A is watching the dog, or if the dog is in A’s pajamas, hence the Language Rule being broken because it states that formulations must not be confusingly ambiguous and must be interpreted as accurately as possible.;
;;"B: ""Wait, are you in your pajamas, or is the dog in your pajamas?”";;
